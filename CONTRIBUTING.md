## We Use [Gitflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. Write your changes on the new branch.
3. Test your changes on all platforms (Android, iOS and browser).
4. Make sure your code complies with our style guide (link).
5. Open a pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](https://github.com/ProgPrak-Native-App/react-native-app/blob/develop/LICENSE.md) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/ProgPrak-Native-App/react-native-app/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ProgPrak-Native-App/react-native-app/issues/new).
